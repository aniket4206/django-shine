1)firstly i have created django project name as shine
ex: django-admin startproject shine

Note: when you used linux not necessary create virtual environment for django project but you used windows you must create django virtual environment fromrunning django application.
you have not used virtal environment you get some error like djano-admin not found or other.

2)then i have created app file for project like:
	python3 manage.py startapp shinelaundry

3)then edit urls.py file in django project to the placed in shine 		directory
	from django.contrib import admin
	from django.urls import path,include

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('',include('shinelaundry.urls'))
]

Add these lines

Note: shinelaundry is the project app name
when you enter localhost link it will goes through shinelaundry index file.

4)create file urls.py in shinelaundry folder projectAppfolder.

	from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path,include
from shinelaundry import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('', views.index, name='shinelaundry')
]


Add these lines 

5)in the views.py write the code as given:

from django.shortcuts import render,HttpResponse


def index(request):
    return render(request, 'index.html')
    
Note : index.html is the main page of our project which is located in templates folder

6)create templates and static folder is outside the app folder
like /shine/templates  orr /shine/static

7)change setting.py file as:

a)For static folder
	STATIC_URL = '/static/'

	STATICFILES_DIRS = [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, "static")]
	
b) for template folder:
	'DIRS': [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, "templates")],	
	edit dirs in templates section

8)put only html files in templates folder
